# Neovim config with Nix
This directory is a WIP.
Right now it contains almost everything I need to write up configs for automatically setting up neovim.
It's missing how to get vim-plug, and I still need to figure out how this will all be managed by Nix.
I think I will do it in the dumbest / least-nix way possible because I am still using some non-Nix platforms,
and I want to be able to use my vimrc easily. Vim happens to be super easy to set up (unlike everything else) so
I don't think it matters besides making sure my vimrc is checked in to Git.
